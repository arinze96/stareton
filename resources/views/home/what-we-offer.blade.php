                                     Staretonfinance believes portfolio management is far more than just buying stocks and
                                    bonds and hoping they do well. We use a tested “top-down” investment approach
                                    combined with personalized planning to build a portfolio tailored to your long-term
                                    financial goals. Our proven approach has attracted a global base of over 900 million
                                    individual and institutional clients.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We want to improve the financial well-being of our clients, beyond just recommending
                                    an investment strategy. We stay in touch as your needs evolve and market conditions
                                    shift. We help you meet your longer-term goals with an investment strategy that’s
                                    specifically designed for you. And we’re transparent about the investing decisions
                                    we make for you because we believe an informed investor is a better investor and a
                                    happier client.

                                    Much like a tailor who alters the hem, sleeves, and collar of a suit to fit an
                                    individual's proportions, we take a variety of factors into account to create a
                                    portfolio tailored to your needs. Some of the factors we may consider when choosing
                                    the optimal long-term investment strategy and near-term portfolio tactics include:
                                    investment Goals, Tax consideration and Income needs. Our dedicated Portfolio
                                    Evaluation Group, under the guidance of our Investment Policy Committee, will use
                                    this information to provide you with a written personalized portfolio analysis and
                                    investment strategy recommendation. As your circumstances change, your portfolio
                                    needs may too. Your personal Investment Counselor will regularly review your
                                    individual situation with you and keep you abreast of our views on capital markets
                                    and important developments related to your portfolio.

                                <h1>FINANCIAL PLANNING</h1>
                                <p>We can help you prepare for the future with a financial plan designed especially for
                                    you. A good financial plan is a blueprint that lets you save, spend, invest, manage
                                    risk and approach tax and estate planning with confidence.
                                </p>
                                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">ASSESSING YOUR FINANCIAL PLANS
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Does your financial plan provide an investment strategy to help you reach your
                                    financial goals and objectives?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The overall success of your financial plan is partly dependent on an appropriate
                                    investment recommendation, based on your long-term financial goals and objectives.
                                    At Staretonfinance, we take into account everything from your family health history
                                    to the specific stocks, bonds or other investments in your portfolio to help build
                                    an in-depth understanding of the objectives for your assets. Using tools like
                                    portfolio simulations and historical modeling, we can provide an investment
                                    recommendation we believe is most likely to help you reach your goals. This
                                    recommendation provides the foundation for your future financial success, and may
                                    help you avoid running out of money in retirement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is your financial plan helping to ensure you leave the legacy you want?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many investors find their investment time horizon may last beyond their lifetime,
                                    giving them the opportunity to use their assets to support someone or something
                                    important to them. While supplementary to an appropriate investment recommendation,
                                    planning for and protecting the future of your wealth are common needs that can be
                                    complicated to address. At  Staretonfinance, we can provide perspective on tactics and
                                    resources available to help ensure what you want to happen, does.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Does your financial plan provide perspective on financial planning topics such as
                                    Social Security, taxes and insurance?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many investors want to feel they are making informed and prudent decisions about all
                                    aspects of their wealth, not just their investment strategy and legacy.
                                    Understanding the relationship between taxes, cash flow requirements, and Social
                                    Security benefits may influence how you meet your living expenses both before and
                                    after retirement. Additionally, recognizing the connection between your investments
                                    and insurance needs (e.g. health, long term care, and annuities) may help you decide
                                    whether purchasing coverage is appropriate.
