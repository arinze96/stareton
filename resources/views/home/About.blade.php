                                    Our experienced analysts continuously monitor capital markets on a global scale,
                                    keeping an eye on market conditions, economic developments, and political issues.
                                    This information guides the portfolio management process in both identifying
                                    opportunities and recognizing risk factors. We summarize this information for
                                    clients through a variety of communications, keeping you apprised of our market
                                    thinking and what’s happening inside your portfolio

                                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">A TOP-DOWN INVESTMENT APPROACH
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Two common approaches to investment portfolio construction are bottom up investing
                                    and top-down investing. A bottom-up investing approach is essentially a
                                    stock-picking method where you focus on individual security selection rather than a
                                    portfolio’s allocation to various countries, company-sizes, security types or other
                                    characteristics. However, we prefer a top-down investing approach. This method
                                    emphasizes broader economic factors. The strategy determines the allocation and
                                    selection of assets based on macroeconomic characteristics and how they expect to
                                    affect different areas of the market. Once the investors have identified the areas
                                    they think will perform well, they can select individual securities within those
                                    areas.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Many investment managers and funds specialize in particular areas of the market.
                                    They might invest in only US stocks, high-yield bonds or even more specific areas of
                                    the market, like small-cap growth stocks. A snapshot of their performance at any
                                    given moment might seem impressive. But what happens when their narrowly focused
                                    investment strategy falls out of favor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In our experience, no single strategy is always superior, and those who adopt such
                                    an approach can underperform as leadership styles continually rotate. At Montary
                                    Trades, we use an active investment approach, led by our Investment Policy Committee
                                    and in-house Research department, that helps us respond to market shifts and their
                                    impact in clients portfolios. Monetarytrades employs a large team of investment
                                    professionals who analyze regions, countries, sectors and industries When managing
                                    investments for our clients, we believe this comprehensive approach to research
                                    allows us to invest across a variety of areas in the market, using a flexible
                                    strategy designed to help capture potential opportunities for our clients consistent
                                    with their goals and objectives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our active investing strategy is based upon our forward-looking view of markets. We
                                    make tactical adjustments along the way, moving clients’ portfolios into the types
                                    of stocks and bonds we expect to perform best. A portfolio that provides zero
                                    exposure to almost half of developed world equity markets is the opposite of
                                    diversified. But many investors portfolios might be doing just that if their
                                    investment firm only focuses on US companies and ignores the 40%+ of international
                                    developed-world equity markets. Such investors lack exposure to foreign markets
                                    whose stocks often trade leadership with US stocks, which can help reduce overall
                                    portfolio volatility. At Monetarytrades, we set ourselves apart by approaching asset
                                    management from a global perspective. We invest globally to help hedge against
                                    domestic downturns, expose portfolios to more opportunities, diversify and, over
                                    time, reduce volatility.
