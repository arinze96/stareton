                                    Our work would not be possible without you: global citizens who want to make
                                    positive, lasting change in children’s lives. We are grateful to each and every one
                                    of you. We partner with corporations, foundations, individual philanthropists,
                                    school groups, and more, connecting our donors to communities and children who would
                                    otherwise be overlooked. Whether you’re are an executive looking to boost your
                                    company’s social responsibility efforts, or a grandmother wanting to make a special
                                    gift in a child’s honor; we’re here to help you make a difference in the world. On
                                    behalf of the millions of children that’ll be impacted by your generosity – thank
                                    you. We partner to build a world where all children and youth enjoy equal resources
                                    and opportunities in society and live free from violence, discrimination, and
                                    exploitation. To that end,  Staretonfinance invests in innovative local organizations,
                                    helping them deepen their impact and build their capacity for social change.
                                    Together  Staretonfinance and its partners advance the rights of children and youth
                                    facing poverty and injustice and equip them with the tools and skills to reach their
                                    full potential.

                                    This one belief guides us in everything we do at Staretonfinance. It inspires us to
                                    grant life-changing wishes for children going through so much. It compels us to be
                                    creative in exceeding the expectations of every kid. It drives us to make our
                                    donated resources go as far as possible. Most of all, it's the founding principle of
                                    our vision to grant the wish of every eligible child, Wishes are more than just a
                                    nice thing. And they are far more than gifts, or singular events in time.Your
                                    donations impact everyone involved- kids, volunteers, donors, sponsors, medical
                                    professionals and communities. For kids, just the act of making their wish and
                                    dreams come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical treatments.
                                    Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might
                                    realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.
                                    kids need hope more than ever because many of their dreams and wishes have been
                                    delayed, they're having to wait even longer. But you can help! Making a donation can
                                    grant even more waiting wishes as soon as we're able. Join our Messages of Hope
                                    movement to provide hope and encouragement to kids during this difficult time. For
                                    children diagnosed with critical illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial
                                    turning point in their lives. A wish can be that spark that helps these children
                                    believe that anything is possible and gives them the strength to fight harder
                                    against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make every one of these
                                    wishes come true.

                                        organizations. Although children and youth may be extremely resourceful and
                                        resilient, they are also particularly vulnerable to abuse due to their lack of
                                        status and power, their stage of development, and their reliance on adults.

                                        The welfare of the child is a paramount consideration, as enshrined in the UN

                                        Our vision is that every child and young person has a safe and happy childhood,
                                        and the foundations they need to thrive. We do this by working closely with
                                        children and their families, from before they’re born until their twenties. Our
                                        work is split into three main areas: To make sure our work helps the most
                                        vulnerable children and young people, we're pressing for change on three key

                                        there's an increasing crisis in mental health among children and young people,
                                        with many are not getting the help they need. Everyone has ups and downs in
                                        life. Our mental and emotional well-being experts work with families and schools
                                        to make sure children and parents feel able to cope with challenges when they
                                        arise.

                                        We make sure more children feel part of a family that cares for them. We find
                                        homes for those without, protect children who have been abused or neglected, and
                                        help ensure young carers don’t miss out on childhood, and provide support to
                                        disabled children and their families, while children at risk often only get help
                                        when they've hit crisis point. Many in care, especially teenagers, face
                                        placement instability. Many children and young people who have experienced
                                        domestic abuse do not get the support they need. How we help children and young
                                        people growing up is full of challenges but with a united effort we offer
                                        guidance, practical and emotional support. We do this in lots of different ways.

                                        Globe, We work to change the lives of vulnerable children starting at an early
                                        age. We’ve been doing this for about 3years. We’ve learnt a lot in this time -
                                        gathering experience and expertise that we use every day in more than 475 local
                                        services, in schools, and online. We make a real difference by doing what’s
                                        proven to work, and by coming up with new solutions. Last year, we reached
                                        387,000 children, young people and families across the globe. We make sure
                                        children get the best start in life. Our foster, adoption and modern residential
                                        services find children a loving home. We protect those who have been abused or
                                        neglected, and help children who care for others or find themselves homeless.
                                        Projects like the Blues Programme give young people the tools to look after
